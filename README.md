# Vaze Robux-Checker

Vaze Robux checker is a tool that allows you to check cookie lists scanning every one of them for the following information:
  - Username
  - Robux Balance
  - User ID
  - Email
  - Account Age

If Robux is found on a Cookie it will notify you once it is done checking and give you the option to redeem that Robux.

Modes:
  - Ultra mode (Checks the cookies faster, but can cause a rate limit.)

Usage:
  - Load the cookies by clicking the 'Load Cookies' button.
  - Start the checker by clicking the 'Start' button.
  - Once it is done checking, enter your username and it will take 5 - 10 mins for all the robux to be redeemed.
